<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>A POSTULATE</p>

<p>Any attempt at a scientific explanation of the phenomenon of
"crystal seering," to use an irregular but comprehensive term, would perhaps
fall short of completeness, and certainly would depend largely upon the exercise
of what Professor Huxley was wont to call "the scientific imagination." The
reasons for this are obvious. We know comparatively little about atomic
structure in relation to nervous organism. We are informed to a certain degree
upon atomic ratios; we know that all bodies are regarded by the physicist as a
congeries of atoms, and that these atoms are "centres of force." Primarily, the
atomic theory would refer all heterogeneous bodies to one homogeneous substance,
from which substance, by means of a process loosely referred to as
"differentiation," all the elements are derived. These elements are the result
of atomic arrangement, and the atoms of each are known to have various
vibrations, the extent of which is called the "mean free path of vibration."
The indestructibility of matter, the fact that all nature is convertible, and
the absolute association of matter and force, lead to the conclusion that since
every change in matter implies a change of force, matter must be ever living and
active, and primarily of a spiritual nature. The great Swedenborg, no less a
scientist than a spiritual seer, laid down his doctrine of "Correspondences"
upon the primary concept of the spiritual origin of all force and matter.
Matter, he argued, was the ultimate expression of Spirit, as Form was that of
Force. Spirit was to Force what Matter was to Form—our ideas of Matter and Form
being closely related. Hence, for every <i>Spiritual Force</i> there is a
corresponding <i>Material Form</i>, and the material or natural world
corresponds at all points with the world of spirit, without being identical.
This, in brief, is the conclusion to which the "scientific imagination" of the
present day, extending as it does from the known into the unknown, is slowly but
surely leading up.</p>

<p>Taking as our postulate the scientific statement of the atomic
structure of bodies, atomic vibration and molecular arrangement, we turn to
consider the action exerted by such bodies upon the nervous organism of man.</p>

<p>The function of the brain—which must be regarded as the
bulbous root of a nervous plant whose branches grow downwards—is twofold; to
affect, and to be affected. In its active or positive condition it affects the
whole of the vital and muscular processes in the man, finding expression in
vital action. In its passive or negative state it is affected by impressions
coming to it in different ways through the sense-organs, resulting in nervous
and mental action. It is this latter phase of brain-function with which we are
immediately concerned.</p>

<p>The range of our sense-perception puts us momentarily and
continually in relation with the material world, or rather with a <i>certain
portion</i> of it. We say a certain portion because we know from scientific
experience that the scale or gamut of sense-perception is limited, both as to
its extent and as to its quality. Many insects, birds, and quadrupeds have
keener perceptions in some respects than man. The photographic plate can
register impressions which are beyond the perception of our highest sense of
sight. The Röntgen rays have put us into relations with a new order of
impression—records quite beyond the range of our normal vision. The animalcule
and microbic life, itself microscopic, has yet its own order of sense-organs
related to a world of vitality beyond our ken. These, and a host of other
observations, serve to show that our normal perceptions are extremely limited,
and, further, that nature does not cease to exist where we cease to perceive
her.</p>

<p>The relation of our sense-organs to the several degrees of
matter, to solids, fluids, gases, atmospheric and etheric motions, vary in
different individuals to such a wide extent that the average wool-sorter
leaves many an artist behind in his perception of colour-shades. The same odour
is perceptible by one person and unrecognisable by another. In the gradation of
sound, too, the same differences of perception will be commonly noticed. But
quite apart from the scale or range of perception, the <i>quality</i> of a
sense-impression is found to vary with different persons. By this we mean that
the same body will affect different persons in dissimilar manner. Hence arises
the variety of "tastes" in regard to forms, colours, flavours, scents, sounds,
fabrics, etc., what is agreeable to one being highly objectionable to another.
The experience is to common to need illustration; but the conclusion to which we
are led is that, in relation to the nervous system of man, every material body
has a variable effect. And this clears the ground for a statement of our views
in regard to the Crystal and its effects upon the seer.</p>

<p>The Crystal itself is a clear pellucid piece of quartz or
beryl, sometimes oval in shape, but more generally spheroidal. It is accredited
by Reichenbach and other researchers with highly magnetic qualities capable of
producing in a suitable subject a state analogous to the ordinary waking trance
of the hypnotists. It is believed that all bodies convey, or are the vehicles
of, a certain universal magnetic property, variously called Od, Odyle, etc.,
which is regarded as an inert and passive substance underlying the more active
forces familiar to us in kinetic, calorific, and electrical phenomena. In
this respect it bears a position analogous to the Argon of the atmosphere. It is
capable of taking up, sympathetically, the vibrations of those bodies or
elements to which it is temporarily related. But of itself it has no activity,
although in its still, well-like, and calm depths it holds the potentiality of
all magnetic forces. This Odyle, then, is particularly potent in the quartz or
beryl, when brought into activity by the intention of the seer. It produces and
retains more readily in that form the various images communicated to it from the
soul of man. And the soul, in this connection, must be regarded as the
repository of all that complex mass of emotions, thoughts, impressions,
perceptions, feelings, etc., included in the inner life of man; for the soul of
man is not the less a scientific fact because there are those who bandy words
concerning its origin and nature. Reichenbach has shown by a series of
experiments upon sensitive and hypnotised subjects that metals and other
substances produce very marked effects in contact with the human body. Those
experiments showed, too, that the same substance affected different patients in
diverse manner. The hypnotic experiments of Dr. Charcot, the well-known French
biologist, also demonstrate the <i>rapport</i> existing between the sensitive
patient and foreign bodies when in proximity or contact; as for example, when a
bottle containing a poison was taken at random from among a number of
others of exactly similar appearance, and applied to the back of the patient's
neck, the hypnotised subject would once develop all the symptoms of poisoning by
arsenic, strychnine, prussic acid, etc., it being afterwards ascertained that
the bottle thus applied actually contained the toxine whose effects had been
portrayed by the subject.</p>

<p>It need not, then, be a matter of surprise to learn that the
Crystal exerts a very definite and sensible effect upon the nervous system of a
certain order of subjects. It does not affect all alike, nor act in exactly the
same way on those whom it does so affect. Where its action is more or less rapid
and remarkable, the quartz or beryl Crystal may be taken as the most effective
medium for producing the vision. In other cases the concave mirror, either of
polished copper or black japan, will be found serviceable for inducing the
clairvoyant state. In some other cases, again, a bowl of water is sufficient.
The ecstatic vision was first induced in the case of Jacob Boehme by the sun's
rays falling upon a bowl of water which caught and dazzled his eyes while he was
engaged in the humble task of cobbling a pair of shoes. As a consequence of this
exaltation of the sense of sight we have those remarkable works, "The Aurora,"
"The Four Complexions," "The Signatura Rerum," and many others, together with a
volume of letters and commentaries which, in addition to being of a highly
spiritual nature, must also be regarded as scholarly when referred to their
authorship.</p>

<p>In cases like the above it may be said that the clairvoyant
faculty is constitutional and already fully developed, waiting only the
circumstances which shall serve to bring it into active play, Emanuel Swedenborg,
if we remember rightly, was 54 years of age before he awoke to the consciousness
of his spiritual vision.</p>

<p>The medium employed for inducing the clairvoyant state cannot
be definitely prescribed. It must remain a matter of experiment for each
investigator. This, however, may be said:&nbsp; <i>Every person whose life is
not wholly sunk in selfish and material pleasures, but in whom the aspiration to
a nobler and purer life is a hunger the world cannot satisfy, has within himself
the power to see and know that which he seeks behind the veil of his earthly
senses. Nature has never produced a desire she could not satisfy. There is no
hope, however vague, that the soul cannot define, and no aspiration, however
high, that the wings of the spirit cannot reach. Therefore be patient and
strive</i>.</p>

<p>That there are some in whom the psychic faculties are more
prone to activity than in others is certain, as also some in whom these powers
are native, by spiritual or hereditary succession; all of which may be
determined from their genitures by the astrological art. In others, the
determination of the natural powers takes a more practical and mundane tendency,
making them more successful in the affairs of daily life than in aught of a
spiritual nature St. Paul has spoken of a diversity of gifts. "One
star differeth from another in glory," he says, in very truth. This distribution of
natural gifts proceeds from the celestial world, and is so ordered that each
person born on this earth may fulfil his part in the economy of life. And
because the spiritual needs of mankind are of primary importance, there are
those born in whom the power of spiritual interpretation is the dominant
faculty, such persons being the natural channels of intercourse between the
superior and inferior worlds. These are to mankind what a certain order of
microbic life is to the body of man—organic interpreters, translating the
elements of food into blood, nerve, fibre, tissue, etc., agreeably to the laws
of their being.</p>

<p>For those who would aspire to the gift of pure vision, and in
whom the faculty is striving for expression, the following pages are written. To
others we would say, Be content. All birds are not eagles. The nightingale has a
song, the humming-bird a plumage which the eagle will never possess. The
nightingale may sing to the stars, humming-bird to the flowers, but the eagle,
whose tireless eyes gaze into the heart of day, is uncompanioned in its lofty
loneliness in the barren mountain-tops.</p>

<a name="2"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>QUALIFICATIONS</p>

<p>There are in existence certain magical works, such as those of
Trithemius and Barrett, wherein the use of the Crystal is accompanied by certain
rites and invocations. This ceremonial magic we are disposed to repudiate as
highly dangerous. It brings into play a number of forces which may well prove
disastrous in inexperienced hands. All action and reaction are equal and
opposite. A child might easily fire a cannon, but could not possibly withstand
its recoil. So in the education of the spiritual faculties, it is better to
encourage their natural development by legitimate exercise than to invoke the
action of stimulants which we may not afterwards be able to control. The
continual fretting of the water will wear away a rock, though none doubts the
water is softer than the rock. If the barrier between this and the soul-world be
like granite, yet the patient and persistent action of a determined mind will
sooner or later wear it away, the last layer will break down, and the light will
stream through, dazzling the unaccustomed eyes with its effulgence.</p>

<p>It is our desire to indicate by what means and by what
persons the natural development of the clairvoyant faculty may be achieved.
</p>

<p>First, in regard to the subject, medium or seer. There are two
distinct temperament in which the faculty is likely to be dominant, and capable
of high and rapid culture. There is the nervous temperament associated, with a
high muscular development, classified as the "mental-motive" temperament. It is
characterized by extreme activity of body and mind, a certain nervous
excitability, prominent features, full osseous development, prominent brows,
intent gaze, and generally a swarthy complexion. This type represents the
<i>positive</i> seers, in whom the mind goes out towards the images of the soul.
The other, in whom the <i>passive</i> temperament is present, and to whom the
soul-images come by passive reflection, as things mirrored in a moveless lake,
are known by the following characteristics: Full and lymphatic habit, pale or
delicate complexion, generally blue eyes, straight fine hair; small, plump, and
cold hands; a high, piping or feeble voice, and languid disposition.</p>

<p>These two types—of which there are many varieties—achieve
their psychic development by quite opposite means. The positive seer works with
effort, throwing out the soul-images by the power of his will, perceiving them
with more or less accuracy, and thereafter turning them over in the mind,
reasoning and questioning concerning their import and meaning. The passive seer,
on the contrary, works not at all and makes no effort, the visions coming
slowly, almost imperceptibly, and in most cases having a literal interpretation.
The visions in this case are not allegorical, emblematic, or symbolic, as in the
case of the positive seer, but are actual visions of facts just as they have
happened, or will transpire in the future. Of the two orders, the passive is the
more serviceable because the more perspicuous, but it has the disadvantage of
being largely under the control of external influences, and hence is frequently
incapable of "seeing" anything whatever.</p>

<p>The positive type of seer exercises an introspective vision,
searching inwardly towards the soul-world whence the revelations proceed. Of
what nature these revelations are will appear in the following pages. The
passive type of seer, on the contrary, remains <i>in statu quo</i>, open to
impressions coming inwards towards the perceptive faculty, but making no effort
towards either outward or inward searching. The success of each depends upon the
observance of that method which is agreeable to their respective temperaments.
</p>

<p>In regard to the qualifications which should supplement and
sustain the natural aptitude of the seer or seeress, the following remarks may
be of general service.</p>

<p>Self-possession and confidence in one's own soul-faculties
must be the firm rock upon which all revelations should rest. The purer the
intention and motive of the seer, the more lucid will be the visions
accorded. No reliable vision can be obtained by one whose nature is not
inherently truthful. Any selfish desire dominanting the mind in regard to any
thing or person will distort the visions and render them misleading, while a
persistent self-seeking spirit will effectually shut the doors upon all visions
whatsoever. Therefore, above all things it is essential for the investigator to
have an unflinching love of truth, to be resigned to the will of Heaven, to
accept the revelations accorded in a spirit of grateful confidence, and finally
to dispel all doubt and controversy by appeal to the eyes of one's own immortal
soul. These are qualifications with which the seer or seeress should be
invested, and if with these the quest is unsuccessful after a period of earnest
trial, it must be taken as sufficient warrant that the faculty is not in the
category of one's individual powers. Haply, the same qualifications brought to
bear upon some other psychic faculty will result in a rich recompense.</p>

<a name="3"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>PRELIMINARIES</p>

<p>Having obtained a good Crystal, as free as possible from
blemish, care must be taken to keep it is much as possible in a dark place when
not in use. The best covering therefore is a black one of soft material, such as
velvet, which will not scratch the polished surface of the quartz.[*] Exposure to
the sun's rays not only scores the faces of the crystal, but also puts the odylic
substance into activity, distributing and dissipating the magnetic
force stored up therein. It must not be understood that the visions are in the
crystal itself. They are in the soul of the seer. But the odylic substance is
acted upon by the nervo-vital emanations of the body of the seer, and reacts
upon the brain centres by means of the optic nerves. That is why it is necessary
to keep the crystal as free as possible from disturbing elements. For the same
reason, when in use, the crystal should be overshadowed by the seer, and so
placed that <i>no direct rays</i>
of light from sun, or lamp, or gasalier may fall upon
it. The odyle, as has been already stated, rapidly responds to surrounding
magnetic conditions, and to the vibrations of surrounding Bodies, and to none
more powerfully than the etheric perturbation caused by combustion—indeed, to
light of any kind.</p>

<p>[*] It is bad policy to buy a cheap article. A good crystal is more than
worth the outlay. Our publishers supply crystals, varying from 15s. 6d. upward,
and from what we have seen of them we can safely recommend them as reliable
articles.</p>

<p>For similar reasons the room in which the sitting is conducted
should be only moderately warm and shady as possible, provided it be not
actually dark. A light by which one can just see to read average print is
sufficient for the purpose in view. The crystal with which we have had the
most satisfactory and surprising results is a cube of fine azure beryl, the deep
blue of its serene depths being peculiarly restful and inspiring. But, as we
have said, nothing is more effective than the white quartz crystal when found
suitable.</p>

<p>It is important that all persons sitting in the same room as
the seer should be at arm's length away from him—farther if possible. Silence
should be uniformly observed by those present. A recorder should be at hand to
set down everything the seer may give voice to. If any questions are
addressed to the seer while the sitting is in progress, they should be spoken in
an undertone and as nearly a monotone as may be so that the seer is not suddenly
surprised into consciousness of his surroundings, and the psychic thread thereby
broken.</p>

<p>At first the sittings should not be of longer duration
than fifteen minutes, but it is important they should take place <i>regularly</i>,
every day if possible, and always at the same hour and in the <i>same place</i>.
By this method of procedure it will be found that a cumulative effect is produced
and success more speedily ensured. The reason is obvious. All actions tend to
repeat themselves, to become automatic, to pass from the purposive into the
habitual, and hence the psychic faculties will, if actuated at any set time and
place, tend to bestir themselves towards the same end as that to which they were
first moved by the conscious will and intention of the seer.</p>

<p>Until definite and satisfactory results are obtained, not more
than two persons should be present at the sittings, and these should be in
sympathy with the seer and each other. When the sitting is over, it will be
found agreeable and useful to discuss the results obtained; or if none are
elicited, the seer can give an account of his or her impressions and feelings
during the sitting. It will be interesting to note these experiences and to
compare them from time to time.</p>

<p>The seer or seeress must not be disheartened if at the first
few sittings nothing of any moment takes place, but must persevere, with
patience and self-control. Indeed, when one comes to consider the fact that for
hundreds of generations the psychic faculties inherent in mankind have lain in
absolute neglect, that perhaps the faculty of "clear vision" has never yet been
brought into activity by any save the most remote of our ancestors, it will
not be thought remarkable that it should be at first difficult get any definite
results. Rather should it be a matter of surprise that the power is still with
us, that it is not wholly irresponsive to the voice of the soul. While, in the
course of physical evolution, many important functions have undergone
remarkable changes, and organs, once active and useful, have become stunted,
impotent, and in some cases extinct; yet it is said that seeds have lain dormant
in arid soil for hundreds of years, to spring into leaf and flower as soon as
the rains have fallen and the climate changed. The faculty of pure vision is
like the latent seed-life. It waits only the conditions which favour its growth
and development; and though for hundreds of years it may have lain dormant,
yet in a few days, weeks, or months it may attain the proportions of a beautiful
flower, a thing of wonder and delight, gracing the garden of the soul.</p>

<a name="4"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>THE VISION</p>

<p>Visions seen in the crystal are of two kinds, both of which
may be conveyed to the perception of the seer in two ways. The two kinds of
visions are: 1, Direct visions; 2, Symbolic visions. The first of these is a
representation of scene or incident exactly as it will transpire, or has already
happened, either in relation to the seer, those sitting with him, or yet in
relation to public affairs. The second order of vision is a representation, by
means of symbol, ideograph, or other indirect means, of events similar to those
conveyed by direct vision.</p>

<p>In most cases it will be found that answers, to questions take
the form of symbols. But this is not always so, as will appear from the
following remarks concerning the manner in which these impressions or visions
are conveyed to the perception of the seer.</p>

<p>The vision is conveyed in one of two ways—first, as a vivid
picture affecting the focus and retina of the eye, perfect in its outline
and colouring, and giving the impression of being either distant or near or at
moderate range, Secondly, it may be conveyed as a vivid impression accompanied
by a hazy and undefined formation in the crystal field. In this form it
becomes an apperception rather than a perception, the consciousness receiving
the impression of the vision to be conveyed before it has had time to form and
define itself in the crystal.</p>

<p>The <i>direct</i> vision is more generally found in
association with the <i>passive</i> type of seer. It is not usually so regular
and constant as the symbolic vision, owing to the peculiarities of the negative temperament. When it
does appear however, it is particularly lucid and actual, and has its literal
fulfilment in the world of experience and fact. It is an actual representation
of past or future event, or yet of what is then presently happening at some
place more or less distant.</p>

<p>The <i>symbolical</i> vision is more closely associated with the
<i>positive</i> temperament. It has the advantage of being more ready and constant in
its manifestation than the <i>direct</i> vision, while on the other hand it is
frequently a matter of speculation as to what the symbolic vision may portend.</p>

<p>The positive temperament, centripetal and forceful in its
action, appears to throw off the soul-images, afterwards going out towards them
in a mood of speculative inquiry. The passive temperament, however, centrifugal
and sensitive, most frequently feels first and sees afterwards, the
visionary process being wholly devoid of speculation or mental activity. The one
sees and thinks, the other feels and sees that, in a word, is the
distinction between the two temperaments.</p>

<p>In the early stages of development the crystal will begin to
cloud over, first becoming dull, then suffused with milky clouds, among which
sparkle a large number of little specks of light like gold dust in the sunlight.
The focus of the eyes is inconstant, the pupil rapidly expanding and
contracting, the crystal at times disappearing entirely in a haze or film which
seems to pass before the eyes. Then the haze will disappear, and the crystal
will loom up into full view again, accompanied by a lapse of the seer into full
consciousness. This may be the only experience of the first few
sittings, it may be that of many; but, sooner or later, there will come a moment
when the milky clouds and dancing starlights will suddenly vanish—a bright
azure expanse like an open summer sky will occupy the field of vision; the brain
will take up a spasmodic action, as if opening and shutting in the superior
coronal region; there will be a tightening of the scalp on a level with the base
of the brain, as if the floor of the cerebrum were contracting; the seer will
catch his breath with a spasmodic sigh, and the first vision will stand out,
clear and life-like, against the azure screen of heaven.</p>

<p>The danger at this supreme moment is that the seer will be
surprised into full waking consciousness. During the process of abstraction
which precedes every vision or series of visions, the consciousness of the seer
is gradually and imperceptibly withdrawn from his surroundings. He forgets
that he is seated in this or that room, that such a person is at his right
hand, such another at his left. He forgets that he is gazing into the crystal.
He hears nothing, sees nothing, save what is passing before the eyes of his
soul. He loses sight, for the time, even of his own identity.</p>

<p>Therefore, when his vision is suddenly arrested by an
apparition, startling in its reality and instantaneous production, even though
hoped for and expected, the reaction is so violent and rapid that the seer is
frequently carried back into the full consciousness of his physical conditions.
Therefore, the qualifications of self-possession and confidence in one's own
soul-faculties have been stated as of primary importance in this domain of
research. Excess of joy or fear at sight of the vision will be fatal to its
continuance and to the condition of mind required for the process of
development. This fact must therefore be borne in mind.</p>

<a name="5"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>DIFFICULTIES</p>

<p>Under this head we propose to cite a few of the obstacles to
be met with in the process of inducing the psychic vision, and some also which
may be expected in connection with the faculty when induced.</p>

<p>Putting aside the greatest of all obstacles—that of
constitutional unfitness—as having been already discussed in preceding pages,
the first obstacle to be avoided is that of ill-health. The importance of a
moderate and sustaining diet in regard to psychic development cannot be too
strongly urged. All overloading of the stomach with indigestible food and
addiction to alcoholic drinks tends to cloud the spiritual perception, It
depletes the brain-centres, gives the heart too much work, and overthrows the
equilibrium of the system. Ill-health follows; the mind is centred upon the
suffering body, spiritual aspiration ceases, and the soul folds its wings and
falls into the sleep of oblivion. The consciousness of man works from a
centre, which co-ordinates and includes all the phenomena of thought, feeling,
and volition. This centre of consciousness is capable of rapid displacement,
alternating between the most external of our bodily functions and the most
internal of our spiritual operations. It cannot be active in all parts of our
complex constitution at one and the same moment. Hence it follows that when one
part of our nature is active another is dormant as happens in sleeping and
waking, dream-life being that wherein the centre of consciousness hovers between
the body and the soul.</p>

<p>With these considerations in mind it will be obvious to every
one that a condition in which the consciousness is held in bondage by the
infirmities of the body is not one conducive to psychic development. The
constitution need not be robust, but it should at all events be free from
disorder and pain. Some of the most ethereal natures are associated with a
delicate organism, but while the balance is maintained the soul is free to
develop its latent powers.</p>

<p>It is advisable not to sit for crystal reading, or indeed for
any order of psychic exercise, immediately after or before a meal. The body
should be at rest, and the mind contented and tranquil. Again, the attitude of
the seer should not be too expectant or over-anxious in regard to the production
of the vision. Let the development take its natural course. Do not force the
young plant in its growth or it will come to a premature end. Take time, as
Nature does. It is a great work, and much patience is needed. The acorn becomes
the sturdy oak only because Nature is contented with small results, because she
can afford to wait and is never in a hurry to see the result of her
operations. And because she is patient and careful in her beginnings, her works are
wonderfully great and complete in their issues. Above all, they endure. Whoever
breathes slowest will live the longest. This is an Eastern saying which voices a
fundamental truth.</p>

<p>The vision is produced. The faculty of clairvoyance has become
more or less under the control of the mind. New difficulties arise,
and, of these, two will be conspicuous. The first is that of time-measure, and
the other is that of interpretation. The former is peculiar to both orders of
vision, the <i>direct</i> and the <i>symbolic</i>. The difficulty of interpretation is, of
course, peculiar to the latter order of vision.</p>

<p>Time-measure is, perhaps, the greatest difficulty
encountered by the seer. It is sometimes impossible to determine whether a
vision relates to the past, the present, or the future. In most cases, however,
the seer learns by experience how to distinguish, and frequently it will be
found that an intuitive impression of the period involved comes with the vision
itself. In our own experience the foreground, middle distance, and background,
mark off the present, the approximate, and the distant future. In tracing the
succession of events, we have found it convenient to think of time-measure at
the outset, bending the sight upon, each month or year separately and in
succession, noting the visions that arise with each in order. And as regards
the past or future, we distinguish between them by an intuitive sense
rather than by any other means, and very rarely is this sense deceived, for it
is part of the psychic faculty we had in training.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the vision appears in the foreground and, as
it were, at the feet of the seer, then it may be taken as relating to the
present or a quite recent date. In the same way, the middle distance indicates
the near past or future, and the background denotes the more distant past or
future. The other difficulty we have mentioned is that of interpretation of such
symbols as may arise. The following pages will indicate some of the symbols and
their meanings. The rest must be left to the intuition of the seer.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>SYMBOLS</p>

<p>Symbols are thought-forms which convey, by the association of
ideas, a definite meaning in regard to the mind that generates them. They depend
wholly upon the laws of thought, and the correspondence that exists between the
spiritual and material worlds, between the subject and the object of our
consciousness.</p>

<p>Among the ancients symbols were the original form of record,
of communicating ideas, and of writing. The hieroglyphs of the Egyptians, the
word-pictures of the aborigines of Central America, the ideographic writing of
ancient Mongolia, are all forms of symbolic writing, drawn from natural objects.
The Hebrew alphabet, the names of its 22 letters, clearly indicate the nomadic
and simple life of those "dwellers in tents." Thus the names of the letters
include such objects as ox, tent, tent-door, tent-peg, camel, fish, fish-hook,
an eye, a hand, a basket, a rope-coil, a head, an ox-goad, water, etc. From the
combination of these simple forms the words are constructed. Thus the word used
to signify "knowledge" is derived from three letters, Yod, Daleth, Oin, which
mean a hand, a door, an eye. The <i>hand</i> denotes action, power, etc.; the
<i>door</i> denotes entering, initiation, etc.; the <i>eye</i> denotes seeing, vision. Therefore
the three ideograph; when combined, denote "opening the door to see," which is a
very graphic way of conveying the idea of acquiring knowledge. One cannot help
seeing the hand of the young Hebrew drawing aside the canvas door of the tent
and peeping in to see what secrets may be learned!</p>

<p>All symbols, therefore, may be translated by reference to the
known nature, quality, and uses of the objects they represent. Thus a foot
signifies a journey, and also understanding; a mouth denotes speech,
revelation; an ear news, information, and, if ugly and distorted, scandal or
abuse. The sun, shining brightly, denotes prosperity, honours. The moon, when
crescent denotes success, increase, and improvement. When gibbous, it denotes
sickness, decadence, losses, and trouble. The sun eclipsed shows death or ruin
of a man; the moon, similarly afflicted, denotes equal danger to a woman. These
are natural interpretations.</p>

<p>Every symbol, however, has a threefold interpretation, and
the nature of the inquiry or the purpose for which the vision is sought must
determine the meaning of the symbols. If they refer to the spiritual world the
interpretation must be agreeable to the nature of the spirit, and similarly if
they refer to the intellectual or physical worlds. Thus a pair of scales would
denote Divine Justice in the spiritual sense, judgment in the intellectual
sense, and obligation in the material sense. If the scales were evenly
balanced the augury would be good. But if weighed down on one side it is <i>Mene,
mene, tekel, upharsin</i>, "Thou art weighed and found wanting"; it shows a corrupt
judgment, a wrong conclusion, an unbalanced mind, failure in one's obligations,
injustice, etc. And if a sword should lie across the scales or be seen overhead,
then a speedy judgment will be meted out.</p>

<p>A ship is a symbol of intercourse, of trading, of voyaging,
etc. If in full sail it shows that the communication with the spiritual world is
increasing, that news from far-off lands will come to hand, that trade will
increase, that a voyage will be taken. If aught is written on the sails it will
be an additional source of enlightenment. If the symbol of death be written
there, it shows speedy translation to a far-off country in which the subject
will die. That far-off country may be the spiritual world itself in which case
the death would be a natural one. But if the ship's sails are drooping, then
it denotes a falling away of spiritual influx of intelligence, and of trade.
Expected news will not come.</p>

<p>Black bread denotes a famine, and if it be spotted with yellow
blotches it shows a plague. This symbol was seen, with a goat butting at it, in
June, 1896. There followed a famine and plague in India, which country is said
to be ruled by the zodiacal sign Capricorn! The symbol was not deciphered
till the event came to throw light upon it. In the same way a leaf of shamrock,
denoting the Triple Alliance, has been seen split down the centre with a black
line, denoting the fracture of the treaty. It would also seem to indicate that
Ireland, whose symbol is the shamrock, will be separated by an autonomous
government from the existing United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In similar manner all symbols arising in the crystal may be
interpreted by reference to their known qualities and uses, as well as the
associations existing between them and other things, persons, and places, in the
mind of the seer. As we have already said, however, the meanings of most of the
symbols will be conveyed to the consciousness of the trained seer at the
time of their appearance in the crystal. Experience will correct many errors,
and a symbol, once known, will assume a constant meaning with each seer, so that
after repeated occurrence it will hold a definite signification.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned, however, that the same symbol will
have different meanings with different seers. It is difficult to say why this is
the case. But it probably arises from the difference of individual
temperament, and the Order to which the soul belongs in the spiritual world.
These dissimilarities exist between individuals down to the lowest of our
sensations. We have the same laws of thought and the same general constitution.
Humanity holds us all within the bonds of a single nature. Yet, despite
this fact, we have differences of opinion, of emotion, of sympathy and
antipathy, of taste, and so forth, Therefore it would appear that the soul
images projected by the magical power of the mind must have different
significations with each of us, their interpretation being in some peculiar way
in agreement with the nature of the person who sees them. Necessarily no
definite rule can be laid down as to interpretation, but it is advisable that
the seer or seeress should be his or her own interpreter.</p>

<p>Thus, although every symbol has some general signification in
agreement with its natural qualities and uses, yet it obtains a particular
signification in regard to each person. It is within common experience that this
is the case in regard to dreams, wherein the faculty of seership is acting in
its normal plane. Every person is a seer in dream-life, but few persons pay that
attention to dreams that their origin and nature warrant. The crystal is but a
means of bringing this normal faculty of dreaming into activity in the waking
life. Yet, as stated above, the differences of import or meaning, even in the
dream-world, of any particular symbol is a common experience. Thus one person
will dream to be wading in water whenever there is trouble ahead. Another will
dream of a naked child when similar troubles are about to occur, Butcher's meat
will signify financial troubles to one person, to another a fortunate
speculation. The controlling factor in this matter is probably to be found
in the constitution of the mental and psychic qualities conferred by the
hereditary and psychic influences converging at the conception of an individual, and
expressed in the birth. Probably, too, an argument could be established in
regard to the influence of the planets ruling at the nativity, and also from the
dominion of the signs of the zodiac in the horoscope of birth. But this would be
beyond the scope and intention of this short treatise.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>SOME EXPERIENCES</p>

<p>The following facts, in connection with predictions made
from the Crystal, have come within the knowledge of the writer, either as
personal experiences or in association with others in which the faculty of clear
vision is active.</p>

<p>A lady of title visited the seer in the month of June, 1896,
and was told that she would hear news from abroad in some hot country concerning
the birth of a child, a boy, who would arrive in the following year in the
month of February. The lady did hear such news, and in February, 1897, a boy was
born to the lady's sister in India. The same lady was told that on a certain
date, while travelling, she would meet with an accident to the right leg. She
fell between the platform and the footboard while getting into a train, and
suffered severe abrasion of the right leg, together with a serious muscular
strain which laid her up for several days. Previous to that the lady was to be
surprised by some good fortune happening to her son in connection with papers
and a contest. This happened at the time specified. Her son passed his
examination for the military college with honours.</p>

<p>Mrs. H. was consulted by a lady of some ability in a
special line of literature. This fact was not, however, within the knowledge of
the seeress. She was told that she would go up a certain staircase into a dingy
room with a roll of something under her arm. She would see a dark man who was
thick-set and of quiet demeanour. The man would take the roll, and it would be a
source of good fortune to her at a later date.</p>

<p>The lady-consultant did so take a certain manuscript rolled up
beneath her arm. She went up the dingy staircase described by the seeress, and
saw the man whose description had been given.</p>

<p>The manuscript was transferred from her hand to that of the
publisher, for such was the man's occupation. The manuscript was accepted, and
later on was published. So the prediction was literally fulfilled.</p>

<p>In the first case cited the vision was <i>symbolical</i>, and the
interpretation was made by the seer himself. In the second case the vision was
literal, and needed no interpretation. These two cases will serve for an
illustration of the two types of vision.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. was consulted by a lady of the writer's acquaintance
in 1893. She was told that she would not marry the person to whom she was then
engaged, but would have to wait till a certain person, who was described,
should come from a foreign country and take her away. This would happen, it
was said, in the month of January, three years later. This event transpired in
due course exactly as predicted, though nothing was further from the probable
course of events; in fact, the lady was not a little irate at the allusion to
the breaking off of her then existing relations, while the idea of marrying a
person whom she had never seen, and for whom she could have no sort of regard,
was naturally revolting to one so wholly absorbed as she was at the time.</p>

<p>Mrs. G. consulted the seer on September 27th, 1894. She was
told she would have sickness incidental to the loins and shooting pains in the
knees. [A figure was seen with a black cloth around the loins, the figure
stooping and resting its hands upon its knees.] She would be the owner of a
house in the month of December. [A house was seen covered with snow; the trees
were bare.] A removal would be made when the trees were without leaf. [A bird
was seen on a branch without leaf; the bird flies off.] The consultant would be
engaged in a dispute concerning money. [Several hands seen grabbing at a pile of
money.]</p>

<p>These events came to pass at the time predicted. It is
advisable to note that in the first instance the symbolical vision is seen; in
the second, a <i>literal</i> vision supervenes; and in the third and fourth
cases the vision reverts to the symbolical. Here we have an instance of the
overlapping of the two conditions of the temperament, the active and the passive state
alternating.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the extreme difficulty of interpretation
in the normal state of consciousness a symbol may be cited which was seen in
the crystal for Miss X. "A shield, and a lion rampant thereon, in red." Now this
might mean anything. It suggests the armorial bearings of a princely family. The
lion rampant might mean the anger of a person in authority, as the lion is the
avowed king of beasts. Its colour, red, and its attitude are naturally
expressive of anger. The shield might be a protection, though little needed by a
lion, especially if the assailant were the fragile Miss X. to whom the vision
had reference.</p>

<p>Now observe the interpretation of the seer. "You will hear
news from a man of medium height and fair complexion concerning a foreign
country. A letter will come in reference to something written by you which will
be the very best thing that could happen. You will score a great success." This
interpretation, which is quite in line with the fact and which afterwards
transpired, is probably as far removed from all that one might have expected
as anything could well be. But we have to remember that the condition in which
the seer voices the interpretation of symbols seen by him is a psychological
one, and no doubt in that state natural symbols take on quite a different
signification to that which they would hold in the normal state of waking
consciousness. How often do dreams have a marked influence upon the dreamer
while still asleep; how often do they assume proportions of magnitude and
become pregnant with meaning to the dreamer, only to dissolve into ridiculous
triviality and nonsense as soon as the person awakes! It would indeed appear
that a complete hiatus exists between the visionary and the waking states of
consciousness, so that even the laws of thought undergo a change when the centre
of consciousness is removed from the outer to the inner world of thought and
feeling.</p>

<p>The writer has known cases of sickness predicted with
remarkable accuracy, the time and the nature of the sickness being foretold with
more or less accuracy. The reception of unexpected letters and telegrams;
their import and consequences; the various changes, voyages, business
negotiations and speculations occurring in the consultants' lives have been
foretold by means of the crystal. Deaths have been foreseen, and even changes
in the religious views of the consultant or his associates.</p>

<p>In one case the writer saw a vision of a public square in
which was the effigy of a lamb mounted upon a pedestal. The lamb was made of
solid silver and was mounted on marble. A Catholic priest came along and pointed
at the lamb. Immediately a flash of lightning came from the sky and struck the
effigy, melting off one of its ears.</p>

<p>This was stated to signify that the community to which
the consultant belonged would immediately lose a member by conversion to the
Roman Church. By the next mail the consultant learned that such was the case—an
important member of the community having gone over to the Roman Catholics
exactly as predicted.</p>

<p>In another case a man was seen dressed in black and wearing
the habit of a judge. He held some papers in his hands which he was endeavouring
to conceal. He appeared unsuccessful in his efforts. A snake was seen at his
feet. It rose up against him. A change took place in the field of the vision and
the same man was seen lying on his death-bed. From this it was predicted that
the man designated by the vision would be guilty of misrepresentation, and would
be cut off by death three years from that time. The prediction was in every
respect verified.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently the visionary state is induced by excessive
emotion, during which the prophetic faculty is considerably heightened. Some
temperaments of a peculiarly sensitive order will fall into the clairvoyant
condition while engaged in thought. The thread of thought is broken, and there
appears a vision wholly unconnected with the subject but a moment ago in the
mind. It would appear that the soul of the sensitive, while probing the depths
of its inner consciousness, suddenly comes into contact with the thin partition
which may be said to divide the outer world of thought and doubt from the
inner world of intuition and direct perception, and, breaking through, emerges
into the light beyond. The same may be said of cases which manifest the faculty
of clear visions while in the hypnotic state, whether spontaneous or induced.
The trance condition frequently manifests this faculty in conjunction with
others, such as clairvoyance or clear-hearing and the sense of psychic touch.</p>

<p>The following instance, which was reported in the <i>Morning
Leader</i> of Friday, 14th August, 1896, is remarkable for its extreme pertinence to
the subject under consideration:</p>

<p>"Last month a man named David Thomas, who had for a short time
been employed by Lord Windsor as his estate carpenter, was found shot dead in a
lonely spot on the roadside near Fairwater, a village not far from Cardiff. No
trace of the murderer could be found, and no motive has been supplied for the
fell deed.</p>

<p>"David Thomas was, from all accounts, a quiet, peaceable
fellow, well liked by his intimates, and happy in his domestic relations. He
was a native of the little fishing village Aberaeron, in Cardiganshire, but he
had lived in Glamorganshire for some years, and had married a respectable
woman, a native of the Vale of Glamorgan. A few months ago he received the
appointment of carpenter on Lord Windsor's estate. He then removed with his
family to live in the little village of St. Fagan's a few miles out of Cardiff.
He had hardly settled down there when the tragedy took place. It happened
on a Saturday night. He had given up work early, and had come home to cut the
grass in the little green in front of his cottage, and to tidy up his new home.
Early in the afternoon he seems to have grown tired of the work and went
indoors. His wife asked him to take the children out for a stroll. He made no
reply, and his wife, busy in another part of the house, did not pay much
attention to his subsequent movements. She knows, however, that he washed and
went upstairs to put himself tidy, and then went out—without the children.</p>

<p>"He seems to have met a friend on the road, and went for a
walk with him. They called at a public-house, and had a glass or two of beer.
Then, about ten o'clock, they parted. Thomas was quite cheerful, and started for
home at a brisk pace. He came presently to a lonely part of the road. A wayfarer
heard a pistol shot and a scream, and presently met a man who was hurrying away
from the direction of the scream, and who wished him a gruff good-night. Two
hundred yards farther on the traveller saw in the dim night the body of a man
stretched out on the side of the road. He fetched assistance: the body was that
of David Thomas. He had been shot about a hundred yards behind, but he had not
been killed outright. He had run in terror up the road, spouting blood as he
went, and leaving a ghastly trail behind him.</p>

<p>"But a weird story which is told in the <i>Western Mail</i> of
Cardiff serves to lend that touch of horror to the tale which renders it more
thrilling than any story which the most daring novelist would venture to create.</p>

<p>"A young girl, who is not yet 20, has been in the habit for
some time past of attending séances held by the Cardiff Psychological Society.
One night at a séance, while in a state of trance, she was seized with a strange
convulsion. Through her lips came the words:</p>

<p>"'I—WILL—have—my—revenge.'</p>

<p>"'Who are you, friend?' asked the interlocutor.</p>

<p>"'David—Thomas. I—was—shot.'</p>

<p>"This entirely unexpected answer was followed by sensational
statements concerning the murder and the identity of the murderer. Some days
after she was taken out to Fairwater—which she had never before visited—and
reenacted in a trance the scene of the murder.</p>

<p>"The story leaked out, and came to the ears of the <i>Western
Mail</i>. Doubts were cast at once on the <i>bôna fides</i> of the girl and the whole
story. An offer was made to repeat the experiment in the presence of two <i>Mail</i>
representatives. The offer was accepted, and one night this week, at ten
o'clock, the little party met outside the Railway Inn, where poor David Thomas
had had his last drink.</p>

<p>"A start was made. The medium walked at an easy pace between a
male and female friend, whose arms were linked. The faint outline of the
road ahead led always on towards a wall of blackness.</p>

<p>"At last they came near Fairwater. Suddenly the medium spoke:</p>

<p>"'I see a pistol right in front of me—held towards me—it is
a shiny one—there it is, held up—it has a large mouth.'</p>

<p>"Forty yards farther on the medium spoke again: 'Hark! I hear
footsteps! I see a man!'</p>

<p>"'Where?'</p>

<p>"'Right in front of us. There he is, creeping along the
hedge. He is keeping out of sight.'</p>

<p>"'What is he like? How is he dressed?'</p>

<p>"The medium described her vision very minutely. Her pace
increased suddenly; she dragged her linked companions on with a lurch forward.
The farmhouse where she first saw the phantom stranger was well passed. She was
following him, eagerly now.</p>

<p>"A piercing scream came from the girl. A pressman sprang to
her side and helped to prevent her body pitching headlong forward.</p>

<p>"This was at the spot where David Thomas fell at the first
shot.</p>

<p>"'O—o—oh!' moaned the medium, twisting her left arm round
to the back, to a spot immediately below the shoulder-blade, as if in intense
agony. Then, supported on either side, she staggered forward.</p>

<p>"A light was struck to see her face. It was the hue of
death. Her eyes were turned until the whites only were visible.</p>

<p>"'Let her go down!'</p>

<p>"Moaning, she was allowed to sink, and lay there prone. Her
moans expressed intense agony, and were like those of a man dying, blood
gurgling in the sound; it was scarce conceivable a woman actually lay there.</p>

<p>"'Speak, friend,' said her interlocutor, and presently came the
slow answer, a whisper:</p>

<p>"'David—T-T-Thomas.'</p>

<p>"'What do you want of us, friend?'</p>

<p>"'I—was—shot!' The tones of the voice were those of a man.</p>

<p>"'Who shot you?'</p>

<p>"A name was given.</p>

<p>"'What do you want to do, my friend?'</p>

<p>"Slowly, distinctly, with relentless purpose came the answer:</p>

<p>"'I—will—have—my revenge. He shot me.'</p>

<p>"Then the medium told them where the pistol had been bought by
the murderer a year ago under an assumed name, and where the pistol would be
found. All this while the poor girl lay prone on the roadside under the thin
sinister telegraphic pole.</p>

<p>"Gradually she revived. 'Look, look!' she cried, in a voice of
horror, 'Look at the blood.'</p>

<p>"'Where?'</p>

<p>"'Here—look! Look here!' indicating spots visible to any one
else. 'Take me away,' she shuddered, but before her frightened exclamation
could be obeyed her body suddenly stiffened. 'He is there!' she said, with a
pitiful horror in her tone, but with her face expressionless and her eyes
still white.</p>

<p>"'What do you see?'</p>

<p>"'The ghost.'</p>

<p>"Then the party returned, shaken in mind and surfeited with
horrors."</p>

<p>Examples of a similar nature might be multiplied indefinitely,
and would but serve to show what has already been stated as a matter of personal experience among
all those in whom the psychic faculties have attained any degree of development,
viz., that the <i>rapport</i> existing between the human soul and the world of
subjective consciousness is capable of being actively induced by recourse
to appropriate means, or cultivated, where it exists to any degree,
by means of the crystal and other accessories, such as the
metal disc used in China, or the Shiva-lingam stones used in India.</p>

<p>The following example of the psychic sense of feeling will
serve to show that all the senses, not that of vision alone, are capable of
development under suitable conditions. A contributor to the <i>Westminster
Budget</i>, in December, 1893, sends the following account of the use of the
divining rod for the purpose of spring-finding:</p>

<p>"A few weeks ago took place
some operations with the divining rod by Mr. Stears, of Hull, who was called to
Mr. S. Campion's farm at East Heslerton, near Malton, to search for a water
supply. At that time he marked two places near the farmhouse where, he said, the
presence of water was indicated by the rod. Since then Mr. E. Halliday, plumber
of Malton, has bored an artesian well at one of the places indicated, and found
a very copious supply of water at a depth of 87 feet, after going through sand,
clay, and a bed of what Mr. Halliday says is quartz and lead ore. Mr. Campion,
who was previously without a supply of pure water, is delighted with the results
of the visit of the 'diviner,' and has faith in his power with the rod. Mr.
Stears has since been called in to experiment on several farms on the Birdsall
estate of Lord Middleton, the operations being conducted in the presence of
Julia, Lady Middleton, the Hon. Geoffrey and Mrs. Dawnay, Mr. Persons (Lord
Middleton's agent), and others. Other farms were visited, and Mr. Stears,
after employing the rod, indicated the presence of water at each. Mr. Halliday
has also received instructions to make tests at these places, and operations are
now in progress. Mr. Stears has successfully 'divined' for water on two of Mr.
Lett's farms in the East Riding, and also at Amotherby, near Malton; and his
success is drawing fresh attention to the 'divining rod' and its capabilities in
the hands of a duly 'inspired' professor. Mr. Stears claims that he can also
discover metals as well as water, and he alleges that not one person in 10,000
can use the rod successfully. His explanation of the power he possesses
beyond the ordinary run of his fellow-men is that it is what he would call
'animal electricity,' because at times, after using the rod for a long period, he
loses his power with it, and only recovers it after a short rest and
refreshment. In the presence of Lady Middleton and the rest of the company he
made several interesting experiments—for instance, standing on a china dish, to
show that china is a non-conducting agent (the rod ceasing to oscillate even
when over water); finding metals hid in the ground, etc."</p>

<p>Mrs. Louise Cotton, writing of the operation itself, says:</p>

<p>"When a sensitive person who has the power of feeling the
existence of water or mineral under the surface of the earth, steps exactly over
the course of a spring or running water, or metallic vein, etc., the piece of
wood or other medium used turns in the hands—in most cases upwards for water
and downwards for minerals. The motion varies according to individual
temperaments: in some hands the turning is slow and but slightly felt, or scarcely
perceptible by lookers-on; with others it rotates rapidly, and when held tightly
by the thumb, the bark of the branch or twig often peels off; and, with very
susceptible operators. I have seen the rod fly, out of the hands, or, if very
tightly held, break."</p>

<p>As yet, however, the majority of people are wholly
oblivious to the fact that such psychic faculties exist, and even those who
possess them, <i>i.e</i>., who have them in something like working efficiency, are
conscious of having but an imperfect control over them.</p>

<p>Probably it is as suggested by Mr. F. H. Myers, these things
are, as yet, imperfectly understood. Genius, far from being a condition
bordering on neurosis or other nervous ailments—as Lombroso and Nordau have
erroneously taught—is an exaltation of faculty which brings its subject into
relations with a plane of life possibly far in advance of one's normal
experience; so that while new centres of activity are as yet under imperfect control,
the normal functions of the brain and other centres of action are left in
neglect. Hence, to the casual observer, the erratic nature of Genius is not
distinguishable from some incipent forms of insanity.</p>

<p>In just the same way the opening up of new centres of activity
in the psychic nature of man is frequently attended by temporary loss of
control over the normal brain functions. Loss of memory, hysteria,
absentmindedness, unconscious utterance of one's thoughts, illusions and
hallucinations, irritability, indifference to one's surroundings, and similar
perversions, are among the products of the newly-evolved psychic faculty.</p>

<p>These, however, will pass away when the faculty has been
brought under control of the mind. Nature is jealous of its offspring, and
concentrates the whole of its forces when in the act of generation. That is the
reason of its apparent neglect of powers and function already under its
control while the evolution of a new faculty is in process.</p>
<p>The would-be seer, therefore, must be prepared to pay the
price of any success which may attend his efforts in the direction of inducing
clairvoyance by means of the crystal.</p>

<p>"The universe is thine. Take what thou wilt, but pay the
price," is the mandate of Nature. "What shall be the price of this new
faculty?" the reader may ask. The answer is the same in regard to this or any
other faculty of the soul: "What is it worth to yourself? That is the price you
must pay."</p>

<p>With this equation in mind the reader is asked to consider
seriously the phenomena indicated in the foregoing pages.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p>DIRECTIONS FOR USING THE OVOIDS AND SHPERES FOR CRYSTAL OR MIRROR VISION</p>

<p>Daylight and artificial light are both equally suitable. A
North light is the best suited to the human eye.</p>

<p>Observer should sit back to the light, holding the Ovoid or
Sphere in the palm of the hand, which may rest comfortably on the lap, or it can
be placed on a table with a stand under it, and a back screen of black velvet or
dark material. The latter materially assists by cutting off side lights and
reflections. Steady gazing in complete silence is absolutely necessary, for
unlike other occult phenomena, the distraction the attention of primary
(ordinary) consciousness is a great disadvantage. Success depends chiefly upon
idiosyncrasy or faculty in the gazers, for "Seers" are very often men and
women of imperfect education, in fact they seem "born rather than made" but the
faculty may be developed in many people, seemingly at first insensitive, by
frequent short trials, say fifteen to twenty minutes at a time, or less if the
get tired.</p>

<p>Success is indicated when the Sphere or Ovoid, ceasing to
reflect, becomes milky, a clouded colour following (generally red, and its
complementary green), turning to blackness, which seems to roll away like a
curtain, disclosing to the view of the student, pictures, scenes, figures in
action, sentences of warnings, advice, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Revival of latent or lapsed memory is one of the leading
features of this experiment. A book of instructions, carefully copied by Raphael
from the old astrological works, is prepared specially for his crystals, price

<p>THE PRACTICE OF CRYSTAL VISION</p>

<p>Magi Spheres are considered the best. The price a few years
ago was £3 3s. each, but the sale having become larger and the process less
expensive, they are now sent packed with instructions for 15s. 6d., in a
velvet-lined specially made jewel case. "Some persons see at once, others after
a time. Women see better than men visions of the past, present, and future, on
the subjects upon which the mind feels anxious. It does not require a knowledge
of astrology to be able to use the crystal."</p>

<p>No. 1, in case, with instruction, 15s. 6d. <br>
&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21s.
